## ✅ Working Features

### Chat System
- ✅ Create new chat sessions
- ✅ Send messages and get AI responses with RAG
- ✅ View chat history
- ✅ Delete chat sessions (CASCADE deletes messages)
- ✅ Source attribution in responses
- ✅ Real-time UI updates

### Knowledge Base
- ✅ Scrape HTML web pages (Playwright + BeautifulSoup)
- ✅ Scrape PDF URLs directly (PyPDF2)
- ✅ Upload PDF, TXT, EPUB documents (up to 100MB)
- ✅ View all resources in accordion
- ✅ Delete resources with confirmation
- ✅ Retry failed scrapes
- ✅ Vector search with ChromaDB (top-5 retrieval)
- ✅ Text chunking (1000 chars, 200 overlap)

### UI/UX
- ✅ Accordion-based navigation
- ✅ Hover interactions (delete buttons)
- ✅ Smooth CSS transitions
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Text overflow handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Backend
- ⚠️ ChromaDB vectors not automatically deleted when sources are removed
  - **Impact**: Vectors remain in ChromaDB after source deletion
  - **Workaround**: Manual ChromaDB cleanup or full reset
  - **Future Enhancement**: Implement automatic vector cleanup by source_id

- ⚠️ Playwright browsers need initial installation
  - **Solution**: Run `playwright install` after pip install

### Performance
- ⚠️ LLM response time depends on local machine (8B parameter model)
  - **Typical**: 2-5 seconds for responses
  - **Hardware dependent**: Better on M4 Pro vs older machines

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Complete Setup:
```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd knowledge-base-agent-backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install

# Install Ollama models
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text

# Start application
cd ..
./start-dev.sh
```

### Manual Startup:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Ensure PostgreSQL is running
brew services start postgresql@15

# Terminal 2: Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Terminal 3: Start Backend
cd knowledge-base-agent-backend
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 4: Start Frontend
cd knowledge-base-agent-frontend
npm run dev
```
